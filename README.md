# COT4500 Assignment 1
 
## requirements.txt
requirements.txt contains all python libraries required. There are no external libraries required for this project, so the file is empty.

## How to run
In order to run the program, make sure you have the required dependencies, then navigate to just inside the cot-4500-intro folder, and run the following in the terminal:
```
python src\main\assignment_1.py
```
This should automatically run the program.
